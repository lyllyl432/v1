        Hello, I'm Lyl! I am a coder, a runner and- confession time -a
        professional napper (especially in air-conditioned places!). I developed
        love for coding while studying at Talisay City College. I basically
        stayed in the library. It's amazing that they didn't put my name on a
        seat for me. It was not just where I perfected my programming skills,
        but it was also the place where I perfected the science of sleeping
        between sessions of study. Why? Of course, because nowhere else could
        beat the combination of fast Wi-Fi with that glorious and ice-cold
        air-con. You might as well say that I was as thorough in getting my code
        to work as finding the perfect cozy corner for a quick snooze. But don't
        let my love of naps fool you — for most of the time, I promise, I am
        about solving problems, learning new things, and diving deep into the
        world of tech. And when I'm not coding, you'll probably catch me running
        off all the extra energy from that sleep, setting new personal bests, or
        brainstorming my next big project. Welcome to my portfolio! Browse
        around, and check out the projects that keep me busy—when I'm not trying
        to find my next favorite nap spot.
